# Go Practice Repository

Welcome to my Go (Golang) practice repository! This space is dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering the Go programming language.

## Purpose

The main purposes of this repository are:

1. To document my progress as I learn Go
2. To store and showcase the code I write while learning
3. To serve as a reference for myself and potentially others learning Go

## Current Focus

I am currently following the tutorials at [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/). This excellent resource provides concise examples for many Go concepts and features. You'll find my practice code from these tutorials in this repository.

## Future Plans

After completing the Go by Example tutorials, I plan to push more complex Go projects to this repository as I code them up. These projects will help me apply what I've learned and explore more advanced concepts in Go.

## Repository Structure

- `/tutorials`: Contains code snippets and small programs from the Go by Example tutorials
- `/projects`: (Coming soon) Will contain larger, more complex Go projects

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse the code and use it as a reference. If you're also learning Go, you might find some of the examples and projects helpful. However, remember that this is a personal learning repository, so the code may not always follow best practices as I'm learning and experimenting.

## Contributions

As this is a personal learning repository, I'm not actively seeking contributions. However, if you notice any glaring issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
